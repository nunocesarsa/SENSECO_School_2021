# SENSECO_School_2021
Jupyter notebooks and data for the Senseco Summer School, 2021 in Plovdiv, Bulgaria


## Instructions to run "seamlessly"

- Download zip file, unzip, and upload as is to your google drive folder. 

Folder structure on google drive should look like:

/Senseco/Models/

/Senseco/Outputs/

/Senseco/Shapefiles/ (in this folder, you should make sure all the shapefiles are on it)

/Senseco_S2Data/ (this folder should have everything that came with the zip file on it)

- Run the various google colab books following the numerical order


## Otherwise

All you have to do, is adapt the path to following files:

Used to generate Synthetic PROSAIL data
- S2_Responses_S2A.csv 

Used to crop the Sentinel images in GEE
- CLBJ Boundary_Square_Small.shp (et al)

Used to extract the values of LAI and Ch 
- NEON_DHP_Centroids_UTM14N.shp (et al)

And finally, you have to run all the scripts (and do all adaptations necessary).
